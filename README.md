# First Jenkins Pipeline Folder

This is my first Jenkins pipeline folder. The folder is going to have only one file called "Jenkinsfile". The Jenkinsfile will create a docker agent with nodejs image and test it with `sh node --version`.

The aim of this repo is to create a Jenkins project from scratch. The purpose of the about-to-create Jenkinsfile is to check the status of Node in the Docker Node agent.
